## Why This Exists
This project was designed to explore the fleeting nature of thoughts.
Originally, I wanted users to download a text file ("void.txt") to write freely.
However, due to technical limitations, especially on mobile devices,
I created this full-screen textbox as an alternative.

## How It Works
- All input stays on your device.
- No data is sent or saved anywhere.

## Why This Is Open Source
Transparency is essential. You can view the entire source code to verify
that no data is being sent or stored.
